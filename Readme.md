## EFT Download Link Versions Grabber

### Requirements:
- Installed official Escape From Tarkov alongside with BattleState Games Launcher for longer then few minutes :]
- Update game or download at last once.

### How it works
This application searches directory where bsg launcher holds their logs then scans through them and finds corresponding links to get ther game versions and unique id's of builds. After that is done program uses this 2 variables to create download links. Ofcorse duplicated links are removed from the output and also all log files are readed in the process, so more you have, more links you can generate. There is no given that links will be still avaliable.

_P.S. There is a way to download files one by one if there is a need i can provide a way on how to create them._

### Desclaimer
